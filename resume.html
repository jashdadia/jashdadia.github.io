					In the summer of 2023, I had the incredible opportunity to supervise elementary school kids at a science fair. These curious minds, aged 5 to 11, were eager to explore the wonders of science. My role involved teaching them important concepts in physics and other scientific fields. I distributed materials for their projects, ensuring they had everything they needed to build and experiment. Additionally, I assisted participating organizations in setting up their exhibits, making sure everything ran smoothly. It was a rewarding experience, fostering curiosity and learning in these young scientists!
<br><br>
					I also had the honor of going to a local community college's Drone Programming and Engineering Camp in the summer of 2023. Helping teams develop and build a sturdy structure for our drone was a difficult undertaking for their crew. I helped them extensively on that. However, programming the drone to maneuver through complex obstacle courses was the other half of the task. I was able to put my programming, design, and teamwork talents to use on this project. I felt the rush of innovation and the accomplishment of solving a useful problem for the children.
