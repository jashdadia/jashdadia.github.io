			Our project aimed to discover which designs could propel objects the farthest when launched. We created and tested three projectile prototypes using only paper products and tape. The prototypes adhered to specific guidelines: they had to fit over a certain-sized pipe, with wings less than 24 inches and a body length between 10 and 16 inches. While I wasn’t the project manager, I actively contributed by cutting paper for the wings, assembling rocket parts with tape, and ensuring consensus on the final designs. I also oversaw much of the work, ensuring everything ran smoothly during analysis and testing. I also coded the entire NetLogo Simulation by myself.
			<br>
			<br>
			Working with materials such as cardstock and duct tape taught me to maximize what I could make with the available resources. Although they weren’t sturdy enough for a rocket, we improvised because they were our only option. This mirrors real-world scenarios where constraints and budgets often force us to adapt materials that aren’t ideal.
			<br>
			<br>
			Our projectile veered off course during initial tests, impacting its distance. To address this, we adjusted fin positions and experimented with shapes. After several iterations, we found the optimal configuration for straighter flight, significantly improving overall performance.
			<br>
			<br>
			Initially, the wings wouldn’t adhere properly to the projectile body, affecting its flight. We experimented with different tapes and sticking methods until we discovered a more secure approach. This new method made the wings sturdy and reliable. Also, throughout the project, I actively demonstrated problem-solving skills, tackling issues like wing adhesion and trajectory deviation. My persistence and proactive approach contributed to our team’s success.
