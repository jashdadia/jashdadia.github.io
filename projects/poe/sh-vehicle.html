			Our project aimed to design, create, and test a vehicle prototype powered by either solar panels or fuel cells. We explored various energy source combinations to recommend an effective power generation mix. The prototype had specific constraints: limited materials, secure attachment for solar panels and hydrogen cells, and size limitations. Although I wasn’t the project manager, I played a pivotal role. I designed the entire car and actively participated in its construction. My tasks included attaching standoffs for the solar hydrogen fuel cell, creating the housing for our solar panels, assisting with gear assembly, and finally attaching the motor. I also worked on the project documentation, which included detailed instructions and a project rubric.
			<br>
			<br>
			While I wasn’t the project manager, I took on a significant role in designing and constructing the entire car. My responsibilities included designing the entire car and actively building the vehicle. Building the car took longer than expected, and we completed it just in time for the deadline. This experience taught me the importance of efficient time management. For future projects, I’ll focus on shorter breaks and prioritize team documentation during work hours to avoid last-minute stress. This was because some of my teammates were off task and took a ridiculous amount of time to finish.
			<br>
			<br>
			Our solar panels posed a challenge due to inadequate space management in the car. Finding a suitable location for the panels required creative problem-solving. Initially, the motor gear didn’t align properly with the gear train that powered our wheels. To resolve this, we attached a slightly bent mini-base plate to the motor. This adjustment allowed the axle gear to connect with the gear on the train, ensuring smooth operation.
			<br>
			<br>
			We faced another challenge: how to expand our car’s space without breaking any rules. So, we built an elevated platform for the solar panels. This solution allowed us to create more room without exceeding the limits. Plus, it had an unexpected benefit—the car became better balanced. Before, all the weight was at the front, making it unstable. With the elevated platform, it balances things out. During our car design discussions, conflict arose. I thought of a brilliant design for our project, and our project manager went along with it, making small tweaks. 
			<br>
			<br>
			In the end, our project worked out well, but due to the other group members being off task, they were not able to help out with design modifications, leaving the project manager and I with less time and less ideas. This meant that our car barely ran, due to the high friction resulting from not enough design improvements.
