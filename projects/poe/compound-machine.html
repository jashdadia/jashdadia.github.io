			Our project aimed to solve the problem of how our clients' plants are dying due to dehydration, as they do not have time to water them. This is damaging their greenery, and is upsetting the people. Our plan was to design and build a system to water the peoples' plants sufficiently, so that they wouldn't die of dehydration. The design must be quick, powered by a quick and easy human input, have the normal VEX materials, and have at least 4 simple machines. 
			<br>
			<br>
			I was the project manager for this project, so I was the lead designer and the head of overseeing building. My team members were very cooperative, and gave some design inputs themselves, which I took into consideration and seamlessly integrated into the project. Our initial design proposal included a weight, lever, gear train, pulley system, an inclined plane, and obviously, a cup of water over some plants. In order to start our machine, we would remove a weight from a first class lever, causing the weight from the other end to be pulled down. This would move a simple gear train, which would then trigger a pulley by using a string. The pulley would have its string attached to a cup of water, which is pulled up an inclined plane with a lip at th eend to tip the glass over, pouring the water onto a plant with a funnel.
			<br>
			<br>
			Some slight design modifications we made were reducing friction with the weight sliding down, and increasing the mechanical advantage of the gear train. Some challenges we faced were making sure that the orientation of each and every part was correct when we build it, since we had to build it using screws and VEX parts, occasionally from the inside out. Another challenge we faced was with the structural integrity of the string, since it kept fraying. Once we were happy with our project, we presented it to our class, recieving many positive comments from the class and our teacher.
			<br>
			<br>
			I was very happy with the outcome of my project, as our success rate was technically 100%. (This is not completely accurate, but out of all of our attempts to run our machine with the new design, it always worked perfectly). The only thing I would change is to try and use less materials, since it took up a lot of space and was very heavy.
