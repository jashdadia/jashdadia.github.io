            I led the creation of ClearCruze for e-scooter riders in the SF Bay Area, especially daily commuters and young students. We found that 75% of e-scooter accidents are caused by bad road conditions like potholes and debris, leading to injuries from small cuts to major fractures, particularly at night when visibility is poor. This also discourages eco-friendly transport. Our goal was to design a product to help riders avoid obstacles and stay safe. However, we faced challenges with the high cost and limited availability of LiDAR sensors, and we needed to ensure the system worked in rain, temperature changes, and varying light conditions.
            <br>
			<br>
            I researched existing solutions, including a Cornell project using cameras and an IMU for terrain mapping with deep learning, and an AI system with accelerometers to avoid pedestrian collisions (Zheng et al., 2025; Jang et al., 2023). My findings showed a 45% yearly rise in e-scooter injuries in the U.S. since 2017, with a similar increase in Dublin, especially among students, emphasizing the need for our project. We chose a LiDAR sensor for ClearCruze because it’s more accurate than ultrasonic sensors, creating 3D road maps to detect hazards and alert riders.
			<br>
			<br>
           We developed ClearCruze, an affordable obstacle detection system for e-scooters and similar vehicles. I designed it to use a LiDAR sensor to scan roads and trigger a Piezo buzzer when obstacles like potholes are detected. We initially considered an ultrasonic sensor with an Arduino Uno but switched to LiDAR for better accuracy. The compact system, powered by a 9V battery with a regulator for 5V components, costs just over $100 and can be mounted on various vehicles, improving safety and supporting eco-friendly travel.
			<br>
			<br>
          We surveyed 26 e-scooter users, finding 38.5% are very concerned about road safety and 34.6% often encounter hazards, confirming the need for ClearCruze’s LiDAR and buzzer system. While 61.5% found the “brrp” alert effective, 23.1% were unsure, and 11.5% wanted more, suggesting adjustable volume or sensitivity to reduce false alerts. Additionally, 69.2% liked visual cues, so we’re considering adding an LED light to enhance the system for noisy environments while keeping costs low.
			<br>
            <br>
			I served as the Main Designer for ClearCruze, building the entire circuit from scratch with components like the LiDAR sensor, Arduino Nano, and Piezo buzzer. I coded the Arduino in C++ alone, ensuring accurate obstacle detection and alerts. Using my CIM skills, I modeled components in Fusion 360, designed the casing, and sourced all parts. I proposed the audio alert system, wrote the Problem Description, and contributed to the Solution Summary. For the presentation, I helped with the Future Improvements and Product Evaluation sections. With my team, I used my POE skills to assemble the circuit, ensuring high-quality results.
