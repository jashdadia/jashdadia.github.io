            The Inch Cubed project is, just like its name suggests, based on what you can create out of
            exactly 1 in<sup>3</sup> of 3D print filament. We were tasked with creating a 3D model on a CAD software
            (I chose Autodesk Fusion 360), and it can be ANYTHING, as long as it:
            <li>has a volume under 1 inch cubed</li>
            <li>fits within the build plate, preferably 6in x 6in x 4in</li>
            <br>
            I chose to create a laptop stand because I thought it would be the most practical in my day-to day
            life. I have been wanting to create an angled elevation stand for my laptop for a while, as it would
            then provide adequate ventilation, which is a need as my laptop frequently overheats. I started off
            by taking some crucial measurements of my laptop's underside, and calculating the angle and
            elevation of the laptop with the stand using the Pythagorean Theorem. Then, I used that specific
            height and width to create a very rough, rectangular elevated/angled model of a laptop stand on
            Fusion 360.
			<br>
			<br>
            I decided to print my project in the horizontal upright position, which made it ideal for strength,
            as the layers would have to go through compression, not tension, so it would be better if the
            layers were stacked on top of each other, instead of next to each other. Otherwise, the structural
            integrity would be a lot less, and the layers would be a lot more likely to split apart. Also, the
            print came out very accurate, since I didn't have many tiny details. However, there were a couple
            spots where the print had a few impurities, such as corners/edges which I filleted, and of course
            the angled section on top was not too smooth.
			<br>
			<br>
            From this project, I learned that the type of 3D printing and the filament that we used is
            pretty sturdy and accurate, unless you are trying to make very precise details smaller than 1/10
            inches big. I didn't get such problems in my part. However, I need to make sure to use correct
            material in model, otherwise mass estimation will be inaccurate, and to be patient to wait for the
            support material to dissolve.
