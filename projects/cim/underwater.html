			For the Underwater Inspection Device project, we were tasked with designing a watertight compartment with mounting features for a camera and a viewing window, using Autodesk Fusion 360 and constructing it with 3D printing, vacuum forming, and laser cutting. The goal is to demonstrate a robust, visually appealing product that can be deployed and tested in a tank, ensuring it meets specific criteria such as waterproof performance and re-entry/re-sealing capabilities. This experience taught us about integrating various fabrication technologies and ensuring the functionality and reliability of our design.
			<br>
			<br>
			I contributed by creating the thermoforming part and the watertight seal, which uses a combination of silicone RTF and Flex Tape in order to keep the hole for the wire completely watertight.Additionally, I took crucial measurements of the PVC pipe and other components.
			<br>
			<br>
			During the dry fit inspection, Mr. Uken pointed out that the seal was not watertight enough, and the O-ring was not properly secured. This is why we chose silicone RTF and Flex Tape to replace the O-ring, as clearly, it wasn't doing a good enough job. However, when it came to testing day, we found that flex tape was difficult to wrap around the PVC pipe to create a watertight seal, and the silicone RTF required a lot more time to set for peak efficiency.
			<br>
			<br>
			From this project, I learned the importance and difficulties of watertight seals, precise design, and fabrication techniques to ensure functionality, consistent results, and reliability. The successful aspect was our ability to integrate various fabrication technologies and create a working prototype, and then improve upon that prototype in order to create a working product. The final result was disappointing because the seal was not as effective as we had hoped, leading to the 1mL of water droplets leaking inside the tube.
