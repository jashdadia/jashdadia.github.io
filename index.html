					Hello! My name is Jash Dadia, and I'm currently a 12th grader at Dublin High School in California. Ever since I was a child, I've been passionate about cars, and that interest has only grown over time. My dream is to become an Automotive Engineer. This year, I'm enrolled in the Digital Electronics course, which will be the final course for me on my Engineering pathway in high school. I am very eager to explore what college has in store for me next year. Additionally, in the last three years, I completed the Computer Integrated Manufacturing, Principles of Engineering, and Introduction to Engineering Design courses at my school.<br><br>
					One of the driving factors behind my desire to become an engineer lies in my innate observant and precise nature. I meticulously delve into details, ensuring their accuracy without any rounding. This attention to precision extends to my childhood days when I sketched and constructed objects using Lego Bricks. I always ensured that my builds matched the scale of my sketches.

					Additionally, my passion for engineering is fueled by my enjoyment of mathematics and coding. Over the past 7-8 years, I've honed my web design skills, progressing from painstakingly copying source code to crafting visually striking web pages (including the one you're currently viewing!). Beyond HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I also delve into Python and C++, creating engaging quizzes and useful calculators.<br><br>
					As previously mentioned, I am currently enrolled in the Digital Electronics course. So far in the first semester, we have covered: an introduction to electronic components, breadboarding & Multisim, soldering, boolean algebra, truth tables/logic expressions, sequential logic, and PCB design. By combining these skills, I find myself capable of planning out a circuit idea using a truth table, then converting it to a logic expression, designing a Multisim simulation, breadboarding, and now finally designing the PCB layout!<br><br>

					Apart from my engineering pursuits, I've been actively involved in competitive sports throughout my life. Additionally, I have a keen ear for music and can play any instrument by the ear. My linguistic abilities extend to fluency in three languages: Gujarati, Hindi, and English. Furthermore, I am currently on my path to earning the Seal of Biliteracy in French by the time I graduate high school! Currently, I'm a member of the Boy's Tennis team at Dublin High School, and I enjoy playing league cricket matches in the Bay Area. <br><br>
					
					When it comes to engineering, I don't just build things, I incorporate my imagination and creativity. I love coming up with unique ideas. Plus, I'm flexible and can fit into different engineering roles. Thank you for taking the time to learn about me!
