					Hello! My name is Jash Dadia, and I'm currently a 11th grader at Dublin High School in California. Ever since I was a child, I've been passionate about cars, and that interest has only grown over time. My dream is to become an Automotive Engineer. This year, I'm enrolled in the Computer Integrated Manufacturing course, and I'm eager to explore Digital Electronics next year. Additionally, in the last two years, I completed the Principles of Engineering and Introduction to Engineering Design courses at my school.<br><br>
					One of the driving factors behind my desire to become an engineer lies in my innate observant and precise nature. I meticulously delve into details, ensuring their accuracy without any rounding. This attention to precision extends to my childhood days when I sketched and constructed objects using Lego Bricks—I always ensured that my builds matched the scale of my sketches.

					Additionally, my passion for engineering is fueled by my enjoyment of mathematics and coding. Over the past 6-7 years, I've honed my web design skills, progressing from painstakingly copying source code to crafting visually striking web pages (including the one you're currently viewing!). Beyond HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, I also delve into Python and C++, creating engaging quizzes and useful calculators.<br><br>
					As previously mentioned, I am currently enrolled in the Computer Integrated Manufacturing course. Throughout the year, we explored and engaged in hands-on projects related to 3D modeling, 3D printing, laser cutting, CNC milling/programming, and thermoforming. By combining these acquired skills, I find myself capable of creating almost anything I can imagine and create a 3D model of, since I now have access to high-tech machines.<br><br>
					Apart from my engineering pursuits, I've been actively involved in competitive sports throughout my life. Additionally, I have a keen ear for music and can play any instrument by ear. My linguistic abilities extend to fluency in three languages: Gujarati, Hindi, and English. Currently, I represent California in Under-16 cricket, and I'm a member of the Junior Varsity Tennis team at Dublin High School. Furthermore, I'm currently studying French 3, on my path to achieving fluency in yet another language!<br><br>
					When it comes to engineering, I don't just build things, I'm also very imaginative and creative. I love coming up with unique ideas. Plus, I'm flexible and can fit into different engineering roles. Thanks for taking the time to learn about me!
